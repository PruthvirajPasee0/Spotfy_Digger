# Spotify Downloader UI

A Python-based web application that allows users to download Spotify tracks or playlists as MP3 files, packaged in a ZIP. Built with Flask, it integrates the Spotify API for track metadata and yt-dlp for audio downloads, featuring a responsive Bootstrap UI with a progress bar.

**Live Demo**: (Add your Render URL here after deployment, e.g., `https://spotify-downloader.onrender.com`)

## Features
- Download single Spotify tracks or entire playlists.
- User-friendly web interface with real-time progress tracking.
- Outputs a ZIP file containing MP3s (192kbps quality).
- Responsive design powered by Bootstrap.

## How It Works
1. Users enter a Spotify track URL (e.g., `https://open.spotify.com/track/...`) or playlist URL (e.g., `https://open.spotify.com/playlist/...`).
2. The app fetches track metadata via the Spotify API.
3. Audio is sourced from YouTube using yt-dlp and converted to MP3 with FFmpeg.
4. Downloaded files are zipped and served to the user.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+ (tested with 3.13.2)
- FFmpeg installed (for audio conversion)
- Spotify API credentials (Client ID and Secret)

Notes

Legal: This is a proof-of-concept. Downloading copyrighted music may violate Spotify and YouTube terms of serviceâ€”use responsibly for educational purposes.
Limitations: Free hosting (e.g., Render) may time out on large playlists; progress is track-based, not time-based.
